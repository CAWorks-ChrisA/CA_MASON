- Removed components that uses Java3D from MASON. Now the program will build correctly with only Java.
- The GUI will now render configs in alphabetical order.

## System that this was tested on:

- Visual Studio Code - Java Extension Pack
- Java Development Kit 17

Eclipse and some older version of Java (above 8) should still work with these codes.

## How to use:
